# aulas_dev-py
This repo holds the notebooks and slides used in the first FEA.dev basic python classes that I taught with [msallum](https://github.com/msallum). All the material is in Portuguese.

The course had more than 160 enrolled students. We formed a class with 40 of them and taught basic programming concepts. At the end, groups were formed and practical projects were made.
